# [eveswag](https://gitlab.com/airships/node-eveswag) - EVE Swagger Interface

Originally developed for [LittleUFO](https://gitlab.com/airships/ufo) as a `swagger-client` replacement, but departed to be stand-alone, this module offers:
* **No limits in tokens**  
  Aimed towards big projects with lots of users, every auth-protected call can take its own auth token and scopes list.
* **Scopes**  
  Every auth-protected call is checked against provided list of scopes, so you don't have to worry about it.
* **Endpoints status**  
  You can always view status of the endpoints without delay.
* **Error tolerance**  
  It can avoid many known errors often happening on ESI by making multiple attempts where it is safe (bad gateway, timeout, etc), and presents errors in a readable format.
* **Avoidance of endpoints with yellow/red status**  
  As an optional feature, it helps you to deal with problematic endpoints.
* **Endpoint upgrade notifications**  
  When some endpoint will soon be upgraded or deprecated, module notify about it in a log.
* **Async**  
  Say goodbye to callback hell.
* **Lightweight**  
  One file, one prerequisite.

And, as it was said before, this module is a part of a big active project, so it will receive a constant updates.
